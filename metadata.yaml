description: "A Political Romance is a 1759 novel by Laurence Sterne, author of Tristram\
  \ Shandy.\nThe novel was the first work written by Sterne, and it can be labelled\
  \ a roman Ã  clef or a cronique scandaleuse, which were popular at the beginning\
  \ of the 18th century. It can be considered a mock-epic allegory that describes\
  \ a provincial squabble between a church-lawyer, an archbishop and a Dean, i.e.\
  \ a \"Lilliputian\" satire on ecclesiastical politics in Sterne's York.\n From Wikipedia\
